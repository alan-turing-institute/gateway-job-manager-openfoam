# science-gateway-job-manager-blue

job manager for the Blue simulator


This should be a standalone Flask app, that deals with running jobs on a
specific backend (in this case Blue).

Start by looking at what is there in science-gateway-middleware.
`middleware/job_information_manager.py`
seems to be a good starting point.

Create a new app.py and factory.py with a `create_app` function, and fill bits
in as I come to understand them...
